# Main process

`services/media.ts` owns media-session selection, serialized queries/commands and stale/error snapshots. Automatic mode prefers an actively playing system session, then preserves a playing or paused selection; manual choice lasts for this run until the session disappears. Commands carry the displayed session ID and never fall back to another player. Windows reads GSMTC controls and artwork through a cached typed CLR bridge; macOS queries only running Spotify/Music dictionaries independently; Linux uses the bundled D-Bus client and MPRIS unique owner names, including capabilities and local artwork. Opening a session uses its cached main-owned application identity/path on Windows, the running application on macOS, or MPRIS Raise on Linux; it does not wait for another metadata query. No cloud music API is used.
Local MPRIS artwork with an unrecognized filename extension is identified by PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP signatures and served as a data URL, subject to the existing 5 MiB limit. Missing or unsupported artwork does not discard the media session.

Main owns the app lifecycle, tray, transparent window, IPC validation and system effects. `index.ts` sets Ripple Next's user-data directory and loads typed state and secure credential storage before opening the renderer.

`services/backgroundImage.ts` serves the configured local background through `ripple-background:` in development and packaged builds. It accepts absolute paths and file URLs, encodes filenames through `pathToFileURL`, and limits file requests to the current configured image. Network images remain direct renderer resources.

Services own atomic state persistence, encrypted API keys, notices, AI requests, app discovery and launch, and autostart. Platform adapters contain Linux, macOS and Windows behavior. `ipc.ts` validates sender identity and payloads against [shared contracts](../shared/README.md).

`services/processes.ts` owns bounded command execution and confirmed detached spawn. Windows uses encoded Windows PowerShell scripts and a shared WinRT async bridge. IPC diagnostics record operation outcomes and safe error metadata; operational launch feedback belongs to the renderer control. Native clipboard text reads/writes use explicit validated bridge methods. See [platform compatibility](../../docs/platform-compatibility.md).

The bundled system prompt lives in `prompts/default-assistant.md`. Before each AI request, `prompts/injections.ts` resolves `{{product}}`, `{{developer}}`, `{{version}}`, `{{license}}`, `{{repository}}`, `{{issues}}`, `{{timezone}}` and `{{current_time}}`. Static metadata comes from `package.json`; `{{version}}` uses Electron's `app.getVersion()`. Time values follow the configured time zone, with `system` resolved from the operating system; `{{current_time}}` uses `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss`. Unknown variables remain unchanged, and user prompts are sent without template expansion.

On Linux, the window waits for renderer readiness and the first confirmed X11 `ShapeInput` region. Keep the X11 client statically bundled; input shaping uses `ShapeInput`.

See the [developer guide](../../docs/development.md) and [repository map](../../INDEX.md).

`services/scrollGestures.ts` forwards Chromium's fresh touchpad gesture boundary (`gestureScrollBegin` / `gestureFlingCancel`, coalescing paired signals) to preload with a timestamp only. Its listeners retain the WebContents reference and are removed on destruction and window closure. It does not forward key contents, pointer coordinates or wheel payloads.

Linux capture detection in `platform/linux/devices.ts` starts with `pactl`. Missing-command errors switch to `pw-dump` and the backend remains selected until restart. Active PipeWire capture is a running `Stream/Input/Audio` node; connection/command errors propagate to diagnostics.
