# Preload bridge

Media reads return a session snapshot. `selectMediaSession` chooses Automatic or a known session, and `controlSystemMedia` requires that displayed session's ID; both return refreshed state and an operation error. `openMediaSession` uses the known session identity to activate its player without waiting for another metadata read, and returns the current snapshot plus an operation error. The renderer has no raw D-Bus or PowerShell access.

Preload exposes the isolated `electronAPI` through explicit `contextBridge` methods. It maps typed calls and events to named IPC channels from [shared contracts](../shared/README.md); renderer code never receives raw `ipcRenderer` access.

The bridge covers app-state bootstrap and patches, secure API-key save/removal, quick-app discovery and launch, AI stream events and cancellation, notices, locale, media, autostart, display and window input shape. API-key material is sent to main for storage and is absent from the bootstrap response.

Keep this bundle sandbox-compatible and keep each bridge method aligned with its shared request, response and event contract.

See the [developer guide](../../docs/development.md) and [repository map](../../INDEX.md).

The bridge also exposes `readClipboardText()` and `writeClipboardText(text)` so desktop clipboard operations use Electron's native API without browser focus/permission assumptions.

`onScrollGestureStart(callback)` delivers validated native touchpad start timestamps through `scroll-gesture-start` and returns an unsubscribe function. It exposes no raw input events or pointer/key data.
