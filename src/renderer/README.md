# Renderer

The renderer owns Island presentation, interaction and feature feedback. OS access stays behind the [preload bridge](../preload/README.md). `Island.tsx` composes feature views and QuickView; `useIslandController` composes the feature hooks.

## State, language and style

The dedicated settings window uses a monochrome palette following the OS light/dark preference. Position choices retain round radio indicators, including inside the superellipse shell. Text fields have a 36 CSS pixel minimum height, matching the shared Select control.

`AppStateProvider` loads the main-owned snapshot before rendering and sends typed patches. Settings and saved feature data live in the main state service. `SettingsProvider` owns the renderer language preference; bundled i18n initializes before rendering and synchronizes the resolved language to the tray. `Intl` formats dates/numbers in the selected locale and system or saved IANA time zone.

`styles/base.css` owns the transparent document, fonts and shared animation; `styles/tokens.css` owns theme/font tokens. Island, shared controls and feature views own their CSS Modules. Keep static presentation there and runtime color/geometry and Motion values with their owners. `OverlayProvider` mounts Select menus inside the Island; `useIslandInteraction` owns movement, focus, pointer departure and menu guards.

`useIslandGeometry` owns the live width, height and corner transition. Native CSS `corner-shape: superellipse()` uses K=1.62 when expanded and K=1.30 when collapsed. The collapsed radius is half the shorter live dimension; the expanded radius is one quarter of that dimension, capped at 30 CSS pixels. One spring clock coordinates size and curvature; tab navigation inherits the visible geometry and decays any unfinished opening offset without resetting it. Background, status border, shadow and overflow clipping follow the same CSS contour. The content wrapper inherits the corners and uses native `clip-path: border-box` geometry to exclude transformed descendants from corner hit testing, while the outer shadow remains unclipped. Reduced motion applies target geometry immediately. Browsers without `corner-shape` keep the former rounded corners, and Win95 stays square.

Select uses nonmodal radio menus. Settings remains scrollable with a menu open; dismissal inside Island preserves expansion. Position commits keep settings content and scroll intact. The clock schedules minute boundaries and refreshes after focus/visibility returns. Battery/device notices preserve an expanded page.

## Feature navigation and scrolling

`ElasticScrollArea` owns native vertical overflow and a stable content node. It observes content size without a permanent animation loop. `TabPanels` owns horizontal feature navigation and uses continuous circular page position, stable keys and inert inactive controls. New requests retarget the ongoing transition. Blur and size interpolate with it; the elastic motion tracks input with a spring and returns along a platform-derived release curve, retaining its current position and velocity when retargeted.

`wheelGesture.ts` classifies normalized CSS-pixel deltas. Horizontal samples tolerate the greater of 2 pixels or 25% cross-axis drift; stronger diagonal/accumulated vertical movement transfers ownership to content. Once a stroke is vertical, residual horizontal ticks keep that ownership until a fresh boundary or quiet gap. Nested horizontal controls retain their scroll until the boundary.

A continuous stream selects at most one circular neighbor. Additional distance gives bounded elastic displacement rather than another page. Native ScrollBegin/FlingCancel signals separate fresh gestures and paired signals are coalesced. Without native boundaries, a 150 ms gap or sustained decayed-tail/rising-run detection starts another gesture. Keyboard repeats use the latest state.

## Media ownership

`useMedia` reads immediately and every five seconds without overlapping polls. It refreshes after controls and ignores polls superseded by an action. Read errors retain stale metadata with disabled controls; operation failures stay in the media page. Capabilities distinguish true, false and unknown: unknown controls can be attempted; false/stale controls are disabled.

`useMediaPaging` and `MediaSessionCarousel` own finite vertical source pages identified by Automatic or session ID. Track changes update the card without rebuilding its page identity. Session order remains stable while the carousel is mounted; new sessions append and closed sessions disappear. A + player dots sit inside the right edge. Single automatic sessions hide the indicators; a manual single session retains A and its dot.

Click, Up/Down/Home/End and vertical wheel gestures select pages. Each continuous stroke advances at most once using native boundaries and the shared quiet-gap/tail rules; pure horizontal input still reaches feature navigation. Noncurrent cards are inert. The carousel respects reduced-motion preference.

`useMedia` serializes selection and retains the latest queued target during an operation. Pending confirmation disables controls; commands carry the displayed session ID. Service snapshots determine the valid selection after errors or session removal.

`MediaArtwork` owns decoding failure and hover for each expanded/QuickView cover. Failure shows a music placeholder; a changed session or URL resets failure. Hover changes remain local to the cover component.

## Launching, clipboard and feedback

Data-empty feature pages use the search page as their size and hint-style standard. `expandedTabSize` supplies that shared target. An empty workflow page uses it and centers its hint with the search field's 20px, medium-weight typography; adding a workflow restores the list size. The quick-app strip appears only when both workflows and quick apps exist, so the empty page has no footer or separator.

`lib/launch.ts` classifies workflow targets and browser input. Bare localhost/IPv4 addresses, including a trailing slash, are classified before path targets. Explicit URLs and app/file targets use their corresponding bridge calls. Workflows await launches in order, pause briefly between targets and continue after failures. Quick-app targets use the typed installed-app/command/URL contract.

Clipboard text uses validated native reads/writes. The hook polls every two seconds and on focus; empty/image-only values are skipped. History remains in renderer memory for the current run. Copy buttons own their success/failure state. Clipboard and device polling continues while Island is collapsed.

`InlineNotices` places feedback at its owning feature using the existing fade-and-blur transition. Launch errors belong to their app/workflow row; media errors belong to music; search errors belong to BrowserSearchTab; settings errors belong to their field. Settings ranges use themed CSS tracks/thumbs/focus states.

`useBackgroundImage` accepts remote URLs or local paths, checks decoding after input settles, ignores stale completions and safely quotes CSS URLs. Main serves configured local images through a dedicated protocol; background errors remain beside the setting.
